# Active-Directory-Deploying-Active-Directory
This project is a continuation of "Preparing Active Directory Infrastructure" portion of Active Directory. Here, I install AD on the domain controller, create a domain admin and other users, join the client VM to the domain, and setup remote desktop for non-admin users.
